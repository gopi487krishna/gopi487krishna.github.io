Background Following files will be modified once we complete the implementation of this System Call : syscall_64.tbl – located under arch/x86/entry/syscalls syscall_64.tbl acts as the registry that kernel uses to maintain the record of ... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>My Experience on Building and Using Vim Clutch</title><link href="/posts/My-Experience-On-Building-and-using-Vim-Clutch/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="My Experience on Building and Using Vim Clutch" /><published>2022-10-01T00:00:00+05:30</published> <updated>2022-10-02T10:44:01+05:30</updated> <id>/posts/My-Experience-On-Building-and-using-Vim-Clutch/</id> <content src="/posts/My-Experience-On-Building-and-using-Vim-Clutch/" /> <author> <name>Gopi Krishna Menon</name> </author> <summary> Few weeks back, I was scrolling through r/Neovim on reddit and noticed a post that mentioned about vim clutch. I got intrigued by the idea of using a foot pedal to switch modes in vim and decided to give this project a try. So before starting, lets understand what vim clutch is and discuss the motivation behind building such a device. What is VIM Clutch? vim clutch is a footpedal that allows... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Fixing a non booting kernel based on custom kernel config file</title><link href="/posts/Fixing-Non-Booting-Kernel-Based-On-Custom-Config/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Fixing a non booting kernel based on custom kernel config file" /><published>2022-09-20T00:00:00+05:30</published> <updated>2022-09-20T20:55:21+05:30</updated> <id>/posts/Fixing-Non-Booting-Kernel-Based-On-Custom-Config/</id> <content src="/posts/Fixing-Non-Booting-Kernel-Based-On-Custom-Config/" /> <author> <name>Gopi Krishna Menon</name> </author> <summary> Recently I was trying to migrate my kernel config across Virtual Box, VMware and Qemu based VM’s and noticed that in some of the cases, I was not able to boot into the kernel at all.
